I am a Ph.D. student researching for **semantic communications**, **information theory for deep learning**, and **wireless system prototyping** at the [Intelligence Networking Lab.](https://cbchae.org), Yonsei University, Korea. Before joining the lab, I earned a B.E. from the [School of Integrated Technology](https://sit.yonsei.ac.kr) at Yonsei University, graduating with the highest honors. My research interest includes semantic communications, learned image compression, and computer vision. I was an exhibitor at [CES 2023 on behalf of Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/yonsei_news.jsp?article_no=213280&mode=view), and am a recipient of the [2022 Qualcomm IT Tour Program](https://www.etnews.com/20220818000080). Committed to community engagement, I have served as a teaching assistant for three years and have two years of student council experience. I also love to solve real-world problems by creating automated, sustainable, and systematic solutions.
